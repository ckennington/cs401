     <h1 id="chapter_title" class="highlight">The Boy Who Lived&trade;</h1>
     <h2 class="highlight">Chapter 1</h2>
     <strong>By JK Rowling</strong>
     This is an &lt;html&gt; tag
     <p>Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were
     proud to say that they were <em>perfectly</em> <span class="highlight">normal</span>, <em>thank you very much</em>. They were the last people youâ€™d expect to be
involved in anything strange or <strong>mysterious</strong>, because they just
didn't hold with such nonsense.</p>
     <!-- Secret comment -->
     <p>Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called <span class="highlight noun">Grunnings</span>,
     which made drills. He was a big, <span>beefy man</span> with hardly
any neck, although he did have a very <span class="highlight" title="VERY LARGE">large</span> moustache.
Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the
usual amount of <strong>neck</strong>, which came in very useful as she spent
so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and
in their opinion there was no fi ner boy anywhere.</p>
