      The Dursleys are a well-to-do, status-conscious family living in Surrey, 
      England. Eager to keep up proper appearances, they are embarrassed by Mrs. 
      Dursley’s eccentric sister, Mrs. Potter, whom for years Mrs. <span class="highlight">Dursley has pretended not to know.</span> On his way to work one ordinary morning, Mr. Dursley notices a cat reading a map. He is unsettled, but tells himself that he has 
      only imagined it. <span class="italics highlight">Then, as Mr. Dursley is waiting in traffic, he notices 
        people dressed in brightly colored cloaks.</span> <span class="funny">Walking past a bakery later that 
      day, he overhears people talking in an excited manner about his 
      sister-in-law’s family, the Potters, and the Potters’ one-year-old son, 
      Harry.</span> 
      <span class="highlight">Disturbed but still not sure anything is wrong, Mr. Dursley decides not to say 
        anything to his wife.</span> On the way home, he bumps into a strangely dressed man 
      who gleefully exclaims that someone named “You-Know-Who” has finally gone and 
      that even a “Muggle” like Mr. Dursley should rejoice. Meanwhile, the news is 
      full of unusual reports of shooting stars and owls flying during the day.

      That night, as the Dursleys are falling asleep, Albus Dumbledore, a wizard and 
      the head of the Hogwarts wizardry academy, appears on their street. He shuts 
      off all the streetlights and approaches a cat that is soon revealed to be a 
      woman named Professor McGonagall (who also teaches at Hogwarts) in disguise. 
      They discuss the disappearance of You-Know-Who, otherwise known as Voldemort. 
      Dumbledore tells McGonagall that Voldemort killed the Potter parents the 
      previous night and tried to kill their son, Harry, as well, but was unable to. 
      Dumbledore adds that Voldemort’s power apparently began to wane after his 
      failed attempt to kill Harry and that he retreated. Dumbledore adds that the 
      baby Harry can be left on the Dursleys’ doorstep. McGonagall protests that 
      Harry cannot be brought up by the Dursleys. But Dumbledore insists that there 
      is no one else to take care of the child. He says that when Harry is old 
      enough, he will be told of his fate. A giant named Hagrid, who is carrying a 
      bundle of blankets with the baby Harry inside, then falls out of the sky on a 
      motorcycle. Dumbledore takes Harry and places him on the Dursley’s doorstep 
      with an explanatory letter he has written to the Dursleys, and the three part 
      ways.
