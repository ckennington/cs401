    <span class="highlight green_text">Mr. and Mrs. Dursley</span>, <em>of number four</em>, <strong>Privet 
      Drive</strong>, were <span class="highlight">proud</span> to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.

    <span class="names">Mr. Dursley</span> was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made 
drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did 
have a very large mustache. <span class="names">Mrs. Dursley</span> was thin and blonde and had 
nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she 
spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the 
neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their 
opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
