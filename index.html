     <h1>The Boy Who Lived&trade;</h1>
     <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
     This is an &lt;html&gt; tag
     <p>Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were
     proud to say that they were <em>perfectly</em> normal, <em>thank
       you very much</em>. They were the last people youâ€™d expect to be
involved in anything strange or <strong>mysterious</strong>, because they just
didn't hold with such nonsense.</p>
     <!-- Secret comment -->
     <p>Mr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings,
which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly
any neck, although he did have a very <span title="VERY LARGE">large</span> moustache.
Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the
usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent
so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and
in their opinion there was no fi ner boy anywhere.</p>
