    Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, <span id="street">Privet 
      Drive</span>, were proud to say
      that they were <strong>perfectly</strong> normal, thank you very much. They were the last
      people you'd <span>expect</span> to be involved in anything strange or mysterious,
      because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made
      drills. He was a big, <span class="highlight">beefy</span> man with hardly any neck, although he did
      have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had
      nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she
      spent so much of her time <em>craning</em> over garden fences, spying on the
      neighbors. The <span class="highlight">Dursleys</span> had a small son called Dudley and in their
      opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
