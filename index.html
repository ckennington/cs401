    <hr/>
    <p>Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of <em>number</em> four, <span class="highlight">Privet Drive</span>, were proud to say that 
    they were <span class="highlight">perfectly</span> normal, thank you very much. They were the last people 
    you'd expect to be involved in <span id="blue_highlight">anything</span> strange or mysterious, because 
    they just didn't hold with such nonsense. </p>

   <p title="hi, i'm a tooltip">Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made 
drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did 
have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had 
nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she 
spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the 
neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their 
opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. </p>
