      A litter box, sometimes called a sandbox, litter tray, litter pan, or catbox, is an indoor feces and urine collection box for cats (as well as rabbits, ferrets, micro pigs small dogs such as Beagles and Chihuahuas, and other pets that instinctively or through training will make use of such a repository) that are permitted free roam of a home but who cannot or do not always go outside to relieve themselves. Many owners of these animals prefer not to let them roam outside for fear that they might succumb to outdoor dangers, such as weather, wildlife or traffic (it has been claimed indoor cats, on average, live ten years longer than outdoor cats[1]). A litter box makes it possible to shelter pets from these risks.
