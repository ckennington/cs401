Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that 
they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people 
you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they 
just didn't hold with such nonsense.

Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He 
was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large 
mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual 
amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time 
craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small 
son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
